## Description


Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return true if you can use all the characters in `s` to construct `k` palindrome strings or false otherwise.

---

## Approach

- First, we know if that there are fewer letters in the string than palindromes we must construct, then it is impossible. So we can return False
- Second, if there are exactly the same number of letters as palindromes, then we can make the k palindromes in the trivial way (each palindrome is exactly one letter)
- Third, due to palindromes having at most one character with an odd count (the middle character), then if there are more characters with odd counts than palindromes we need to construct, than it is impossible. Otherwise, we can construct the palindromes once more in a trivial way (each palindrome is a mirror of the even count letters, and the odd is either by itself or in the middle of the string)

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length s. Takes O(n) time to build the frequency count and to traverse the hashmap to count the values. So O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length s.

## Notes

This one took some thinking about the nature of palindromes to solve!
