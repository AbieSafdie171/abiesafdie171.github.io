## Description


You are given a map of a server center, represented as a `m * n` integer matrix grid, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.

---

## Approach

- First, we create hash maps to save the number of servers in each row and column. The keys are the row/column and the value is a tuple that is: (num of computers, idx of last server seen)
- Second, we iterate through our row hash map and add the computers from that row if they have at least 2 computers in their row/col. Otherwise, don't add
- Lastly, return the count!

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(nm), where `n` is the number of rows and m is the number of columns
- **Space Complexity**: O(nm), where `n` is the number of rows and m is the number of columns

## Notes

This one was fun and felt really satisfying when I hit submit and it was all green!
