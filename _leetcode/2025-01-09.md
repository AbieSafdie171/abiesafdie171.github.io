## Description

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

Return the number of strings in `words` that contain `pref` as a prefix.

A prefix of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.

---

## Approach

- We want to return the number of words whose prefixes match the given prefix. 
- First, we can pre-process our array of words in-place to only include the letters that match the length of the prefix. 
- Then, we can iterate over our `words` array and perform the comparison, incrementing our result on matches.

---

## Implementation

- Utilized two basic for loops to iterate over our `words` array and perform the comparison.

---

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k), where `n` is the length of the words and `k` is the length of the prefix.
  - This is true because our first loop iterates over the `n` words, and then the slicing operation stores the `k` letters of the prefix. This makes the operation O(n * k).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * k)
  - Our modified array stores `n` words and `k` letters of each word.
