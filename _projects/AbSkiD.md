## "Inside Cover Blurb"

Welcome to A B Ski D, a skiing resort on Mars! This game features characters from my life, any of which you can choose from! They each possess a special "X-Factor"

Your goal is to ski down this mythical snow-capped mountain on Mars as long as you can! Make sure you don't drink too much and keep your oxygen and warmth levels high enough! Other than that, remember to spend all your money at our resort... it cost a ton of money to import all those trees to Mars...
