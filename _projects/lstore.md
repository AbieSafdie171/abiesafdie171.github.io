## About This Project

Developed a multithreaded L-Store Database ([See L-Store Paper]( {{ "/assets/files/lstore.pdf" | relative_url }} )) that was capable of managing millions of records. Further, I developed an efficient page caching and concurrency control mechanisms for scalable storage operations and ensured ACID compliance through strict two-phase locking for concurrency control.
