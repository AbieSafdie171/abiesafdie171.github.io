## About This Project

The CalCOFI (California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations) dataset tracks oceanic data off the coast of California. It is jointly managed by NOAAâ€™s Fisheries Service, the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, and various academic institutions. (https://calcofi.org/data/oceanographic-data/bottle-database/)

I developed a report that attempts to answer the question: What influence will rising temperatures have on California's coastal marine ecosystems?
